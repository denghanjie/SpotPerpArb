# SpotPerpArb

This is a very rudimentary version of SpotPerpArb on Hyperliquid.

To run the program, first install [hyperliquid-python-sdk](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/)

Second, rename "config.json.example" into "config.json".

Third, set up an Arbitrum account and put its private key in "secret_key" and account address in "account_address" in the "config.json" file you just renamed above.

Run and go.
