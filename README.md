# Intro
The gist of this arbitrage is to buy spot and open short such that we get zero risk but at the same time make money through collecting funding payment.
The biggest cost of this arbitrage is trading fee so we spent a lot of time trying to leverage maker fee.

# SpotPerpArb

This is a very rudimentary version of SpotPerpArb on Hyperliquid.

To run the program, first install [hyperliquid-python-sdk](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/)

Second, rename "config.json.example" into "config.json".

Third, set up an Arbitrum account and put its private key in "secret_key" and account address in "account_address" in the "config.json" file you just renamed above.

Run and go.
